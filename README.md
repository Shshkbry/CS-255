**- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?**<br><br>
DriverPass was a driver instructor company. The system they requested was one that could be used to facilitate their driving instuction services, including a new feature with online lessons and an appointment booking process. I think I did well in brainstorming the user cases for this system. I feel like I was very thorough.<br><br>
**- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**<br><br>
I would have spent more time on my UML diagrams. I waited too long and didn't give myself enough time to familiarize myself to the LucidChart software as well as I could have.<br><br>
**- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**<br><br> 
I read through the DriverPass interviews and took detailed notes as I read. I organized their wants by use case and the actors that would implement each. The whole reason for doing this work is to provide a useful, workable service to a client. To ignore their needs is just a waste of everyone's time.<br><br>
**- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**<br><br>
I like to begin by taking very detailed notes during the preliminary fact finding process.
